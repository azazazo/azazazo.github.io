# Hi!
I'm azazo, but you may also see me online with a username satisfying the regex `a(za)+zo`. I'm currently a student studying (mainly) Computer Science in Singapore ðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡¬.
<div style="display: none"> im also a furry but im not that active in the fandom (although i would like to be) yippee social anxiety</div>

# Interests
It's hard to give a definite list because my interest in things wax and wane, but for now I'm interested in:

- CTFs (particularly cryptography and reverse engineering)
- Linguistics (not to be confused with language learning)
- Language learning (not to be confused with linguistics)
- Algebraic geometry

# Contact
I'm not a very social person, and I have trouble talking to others. If you still want to talk to me, I'm pretty active on Discord and Twitter, but no guarantees as to whether I'll respond (I'll try my best)
- Discord: azazazo
- Twitter: @azazazazazo

# About this website
Originally I wanted to put together my own blogging framework-slash-system (called kakugo), but my burnout is crippling me so I settled for Hugo. I guess this place is a placeholder until I finally finish kakugo. See you there soonâ„¢?
