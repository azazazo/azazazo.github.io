# Interests
It's hard to give a definite list because my interest in things wax and wane, but for now I'm interested in:

- CTFs (particularly cryptography and reverse engineering)
- Linguistics (not to be confused with language learning)
- Language learning (not to be confused with linguistics)
- Algebraic geometry

# Contact
I'm not a very social person, and I have trouble talking to others. If you still want to talk to me, I'm pretty active on Discord and Twitter, but no guarantees as to whether I'll respond (I'll try my best)
