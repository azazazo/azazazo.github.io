I'm azazo, but you may also see me online with a username satisfying the regex `a(za)+zo`. I'm currently a student studying (mainly) Computer Science in Singapore ðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡¬.

# Interests
It's hard to give a definite list because my interest in things wax and wane, but for now I'm interested in:

- CTFs (particularly cryptography and reverse engineering)
- Linguistics (not to be confused with language learning)
- Language learning (not to be confused with linguistics)
- Algebraic geometry
