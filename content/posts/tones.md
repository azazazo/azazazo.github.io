(Mandarin) Chinese famously has four tones. It is also arguably the most well known tonal language, both in terms of how many speakers it has and how many people know of it. I like tonal languages a lot, and I also happen to be a native speaker of Mandarin Chinese, so I thought I would spend some time talking (writing?) about tones in Chinese, but that isn't nearly enough content, so I'll be discussing some other languages as well.

# Tones
It would do us good to first explain what tone is. Tonal languages assign a *pitch contour* to every syllable, and differences in pitch can indicate differences in meaning. Notably, it is different from intonation or stress, in ways that I am probably not qualified enough to explain.

Mandarin Chinese has four tones (or five, depending on how you count[^1]).

[^1]: the fifth tone is referred to as 轻声 (qíng shéng, literally soft tone). it is only used for certain words of low "lexicality" (mostly particles), and varies in tone contour a lot based on the tone of the preceding word. as such, some people dont really view it as a separate tone
